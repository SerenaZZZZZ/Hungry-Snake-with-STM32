# Hungry-Snake-with-STM32

Player controls the snake with 'WASD'.
The snake can run into the wall.
Treasure: when the snake run into the right lower side of the wall, there is a bunch of hiden money there. Bottom banner LGB flashs.
When the 'health' is lower than 50, the health status will flash to remind the player.
A status area on the right side of the screen can show the snake length, health, and money count.
'TOP' area on the right side can record the best 3 players' name and score.
On the "Game Over" face, the player's name will only be asked when the score of current round is higher than the top 3 scores, otherwise the score of current round will only be displayed rather than saved.
